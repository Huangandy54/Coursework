(5)Files for submission: Lex.java List.java ListClient.java Makefile README 

List.java includes all the required functions listed in the pdf. This is for Lex.java to use and indirectly sort the inputs
Lex.java uses List.java to sort. It does not use any direct sorting methods but instead using the List ADT functions to properly place things in the correct place.
ListClient.java was provided for testing our List.java and we are told to submit this file unchanged with our project
Makefile "make" will create an executable jar called Lex. It can also "make clean" to remove Lex and any associated .class files.
