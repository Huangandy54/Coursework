(7)Files for submission: Sparse.java List.java ListTest.java Matrix.java MatrixTest.java Makefile README 

-Sparse.java Reads input file and creates 2 matrixes. Then does the operations given in pdf and writes them to an out file. Uses Matrix.java which uses List.java
-List.java includes all the required functions listed in the pdf. This is for Matrix.java to use to make a matrix using Lists as rows.
-ListTest.java tests the List.java but not much change was done to it since List.java is similar to pa1 with alterations.
-Matrix.java uses List.java to make matrices. Lists are rows and inside the list we hold the private class Entry from Matrix.java
-MatrixTest.java Built off the given one with a bunch more lines of commented out testing.
-Makefile "make" will create an executable jar called Lex. It can also "make clean" to remove Lex and any associated .class files.
