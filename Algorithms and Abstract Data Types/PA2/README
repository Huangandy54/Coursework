List.h header file for List.c
List.c includes all the required functions listed in the pdf. This is for Lex.c to use and indirectly sort the inputs
Lex.c uses List.c to sort. It does not use any direct sorting methods but instead using the List ADT functions to properly place things in the correct place.
ListClient.c was provided for testing our List.c and we are told to submit this file unchanged with our project
Makefile "make" will create executable called Lex. It can also "make clean" to remove Lex and any associated .o files.
