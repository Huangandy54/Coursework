The text of your prompt (“Please input a positive integer: ”) and output strings
(“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your
program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?

The range of the addresses in which the strings are stored are 0x1001 0000 -
0x1001 0028. These values fall under the range of Static Data which has a range from 0x1001 000 - 0x1004 0000.

What were the learning objectives of this lab?

The learning objectives of this lab were to get us familiar with the MIPS assembly language  to learn all of the essential commands and operands that we would need for future assignments. Learning how to loop was a good way to teach us how to branch and the assignment overall taught us how to store values in registers and to use syscalls to do what we wanted to do.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?

I didn't really encounter any issues with the lab itself except for when it came to trying to create my loops as I was struggling to figure out how to create my loop while using the textbook as reference. In the end I decided to just use Cory's HelloWorld.asm as a guideline for how to create my loop and was able to understand how the loops worked.The partys of this lab that I found enjoyable were actually being able to type out code again since the previous 2 labs involved connecting wires to receivers and logic gates which was a new experience but didn't bring the same experience that actually typing code did. I also found that learning this new language was pretty enjoyable as it's always fun to learn new languages.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?

Overall I think that this lab was designed pretty well as sort of a "intro" to MIPS assignment; it wasn't too challenging and wasn't too easy as well. I think the one thing that I would change about the lab is the notion that we had to learn MIPS on our own. Having to learn on our own isn't a bad thing at all, but for those who aren't proficient in learning on their own compared to learning in a classroom setting may have struggled to learn MIPS.
